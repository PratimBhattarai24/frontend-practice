# FullStack_Info_Lab02

*Let’s recreate Netflix!*

- Fork and clone this gitub repository
- Add the other movies with their appropriate titles
- Include links so that all the navigation works
- Create an equal-sized grid so that all four movies fall within one line (hint: use .other-news-item)
- Fit each movie within each grid (hint: use .other-news-item)
- Fix the header so that it doesn’t move from the top of the window
- Inspect the DOM to style according to Netflix colors
- Use inline-block instead of float for the id: #site-title
